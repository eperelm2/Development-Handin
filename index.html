    <h2 class="description">Competitive Comparison and Functional Interface</h2>
  
   
    <h2 class="body-text">Overview</h2>
    During this project, I focused on comparisons between competitor company’s web applications 
    and how their features, or lack thereof, can be used to create a functional aggregator 
    interface. To start, I created a Competitive Comparison chart between three competitive 
    companies utilizing favoriting functionality. From here, I reflected on the different 
    companies’ strengths and weaknesses and how they differ. I then utilized React to create 
    an interface storing songs, with the ability to filter, sort, and add to an aggregate liked 
    song list. 
    <br> <br>


    This project offered the opportunity to utilize and improve my skills with statistical testing and 
    learn the impact of design choices. I can now identify the correct statistical test to reach confident 
    conclusions about two alternate designs' impact on a user's interactions and decisions with/on a webpage.

     <h2 class="body-text">Comparative Analysis</h2>

     I looked at the differences between competitors Spotify, Amazon, and Gmail for adding items to a favorites list. I identified key information and how each interface incorporates aggregators. I also investigated the use of filtering and sorting within the favoriting aggregator.

    <h3 class="body-text"> Summary</h3>
    <h4>Conclusions:</h4>
    From the Competitive Comparison Chart, I saw that two of the websites had no way of indicating that an item was included in their favorites list/cart. Not including this feature makes it extremely difficult to know if you have already added an item or not, likely confusing the user. The user also has the ability to filter through the favorites list, but only on two of the applications. Incorporating this filtering feature likely increases a user’s effectiveness when interacting with an aggregator. In different applications, there are unique possibilities for recommendations of what to add to the aggregator list based on realisticness. For example, recommendations for Starred Emails would not be particularly helpful because an AI algorithm will likely not apply to what a user finds helpful or worthy of a star. On Spotify, the design demonstrates clear filtering and sorting to allow users to quickly go through the songs. However, Spotify does not offer recommendations because a user’s favorite and most enjoyable songs can only be discerned by that user. Additionally, the visual hierarchy of characteristics and songs is clear and understandable by a user. 


    <h4>Features to implement:</h4>
    When building my own interface, I would aim for clarity when an object has been added to an aggregator list. I would also like to be able to see the contents of the list and add to it at the same time. I also think visual awareness of the possible filtering features is a great addition and beneficial to a user. Overall, I think the more clarity and awareness there is for existing features the less confusion users face.  
    
    <h2 class="body-text">Implementation of Interface</h3>
    
        For my interface, I am going to create a list of songs, including their cover photo, artist, title, length, rating (out of 5 stars), and genre. I am going to create two filter features to filter based on the rating of the song as well as the genre of the song. I plan on having sort functionality that organizes the songs based on their lengths. Each song will have the option to be favorited and added to an aggregator list. A user can see how many songs are in the favorites list as well as their title, length, and have the ability to remove the songs from this list. The user is also able to see if an item is in the favorites list on the song card in the dashboard. A user can continue to click the heart icon on a song’s card to add or remove the song from the favorites list. <br> <br>

    <h2 class="body-text">Takeaways and Limitations</h2> 

    Overall, through analyses of competitive companies, I was able to identify positive and negative features of interfaces. I utilized this information to design a functional aggregator interface listing songs, identifying characteristics that can be filtered and sorted on, and the ability to add these songs to an aggregated favorites list.
