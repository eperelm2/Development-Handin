    <h2 class="body-text">Overview</h2>
    During this project, I focused on comparing competitor companies' web applications by identifying features, or lack thereof, that can be used to create an efficient functional aggregator interface. 
    Many companies try to differentiate their interfaces by including interesting buttons or attempting to declutter the webpage. I investigated the use of these features by starting with 
    a Competitive Comparison Chart between three companies utilizing favoriting functionality: Spotify, Amazon, and Gmail. From here, I reflected on the three companies' strengths and weaknesses and how they differ. I then took this information and utilized React to create an interface storing songs, which can filter, sort, and add to an aggregate liked song list.

     <h2 class="body-text">Comparative Analysis</h2>

     I looked at the differences between competitors Spotify, Amazon, and Gmail and how they handle adding items to a favorites list. I identified key information and how each interface incorporates aggregators. I also investigated the use of filtering and sorting within the favoriting aggregator.

    <h3 class="body-text"> Summary</h3>
    <h4>Conclusions:</h4>
    
    From the Competitive Comparison Chart, I saw that two websites did not indicate that an item was included in their favorites list/cart. Not including this feature makes it extremely difficult to know if you have already added an item, likely confusing the user. The user can also filter through the favorites list, but only on two applications. This filtering feature increases a user’s effectiveness when interacting with the aggregator. In different applications, there are unique possibilities for recommendations of what to add to the aggregator list based on realisticness. For example, recommendations for Starred Emails would not be particularly helpful because an AI algorithm will likely not apply to what a user finds helpful or worthy of starring. However, this can be particularly helpful for an application like Amazon. Gmail and Amazon also use conceputal models to demonstrate an email with a letter icon and a shopping cart to represent a physical cart.<br><br>
    Spotify's design demonstrates clear filtering and sorting to allow users to browse the songs quickly. However, Spotify does not offer recommendations because only a specific user can discern their favorite and most enjoyable songs. Additionally, the visual hierarchy of characteristics and songs is clear and understandable by a user.       <br><br>

    There is no clarity on Amazon if an item has been added to your cart when scrolling through offered items. However, the application shares similar products when the user is looking at the cart to help find the best deals and prices. The interface can also make removing an item from the cart difficult, especially due to small fonts and similarly named buttons.    <br><br>

    For Gmail, there is a clear classification if an email has been Starred and marked as a favorite, but there is no way to add similar emails to the Starred folder when looking at all Starred emails.

    
    <h4>Features to implement:</h4>
    When building my own interface, I would aim for clarity about when an object has been added to an aggregator list. I would also like to see the list's contents and add to it simultaneously. Visual awareness of the possible filtering features is a great addition and beneficial to a user. With this, I want to incorporate UI that allows a user to know a button has been pressed or is being hovered over. Overall, the more clarity and awareness there is for existing features and their functionality, the less confusion users face.    
    <h2 class="body-text">Implementation of Interface</h3>
    
        I created a dashboard with a list of songs, including their cover photo, artist, title, length, rating (out of 5 stars), and genre. I have two filterable features to allow filtering based on the rating of the song as well as the genre of the song. I have a sort functionality that organizes the songs based on their lengths. Each song will have the option to be favorited and added to an aggregator list. A user can see how many songs are in the favorites list, as well as the songs' titles and lengths, and can remove the songs from this list. The user can also see if an item is in the favorites list on the song card in the dashboard. A user can continue to click the heart icon on a song's card to add or remove the song from the favorites list.

    <h2 class="body-text">Takeaways and Limitations</h2> 

    Overall, I identified positive and negative features of favoriting interfaces through analyses of competitive companies. I utilized this information to design a functional and effective aggregator interface listing songs, identifying characteristics that can be filtered and sorted, and the ability to add these songs to an aggregated favorites list.
